# Overview
This project involves creating a normalized SQL database derived from a dataset of Netflix shows and movies. The original dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies .
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data normalization and SQL database creation skills, transforming a flat CSV file into a structured and normalized SQL database.
The project aims to provide users with a seamless experience for exploring content, discovering new titles, and obtaining valuable insights through efficient SQL queries.
# Business Problem
In an era where streaming services like Netflix play a pivotal role in the entertainment industry, Netflix wants to recognizes the need to optimize the user experience and enhance content recommendations. The current system lacks precision in recommending movies and TV shows to users, resulting in suboptimal user engagement and retention and are unsure how to effectively analyze and extract meaningful insights from it. Users often struggle to discover content that aligns with their preferences, leading to potential dissatisfaction and decreased platform loyalty.
# How can I solve the problem
To address this challenge, my project aims to leverage SQL analytics to analyze user behavior, preferences, and content metadata. By developing a robust data analytics solution, we intend to provide personalized and accurate suggestions to users, ultimately improving their viewing experience. I will be utilizing SQL and Data visualization tool like Power bi to extract relevant information and conduct insightful analyses. By leveraging SQL's functions, I can uncover key metrics such as viewer ratings, popularity trends, genre preferences, and viewership patterns. Once the data has been extracted and prepared then i will move to Power bi to present the findings. Additionally, we aim to identify patterns in user engagement, viewership trends, and content popularity to inform strategic content acquisition decisions.
